IMAT1908 Intro to Object Oriented Programming C++
Lab 4 – Method Overloading and Inheritance.

Objectives
The objectives for this week are:
• Understand the process of method overloading and its application.
• implement both an extension of the quadruped example and incorporate an
additional animal.

Tasks

Task 1
+ You will need to finish last week’s lab in order to progress into this week.
+ Make sure that you have followed the code from the lecture and commented were needed so that you understand the process.
+ With this code, add an additional animal to the cat and dog. You can choose.
+ Additionally, add a subclass of one of the animals so you understand this process also. You will need a header (placed in the include folder) and a source file (placed in the src folder).
+ The animal could perhaps be a breed of the animal or a type (Bull terrier / Small etc.).

Task 2
• To the additional subclass, add a method overload.
• In your main, include the construction of the additional animal and use the overloaded methods.
+ With the method overloading use the inheritance in more broad way, show the inheritance between each class.
+ As there will be different class, there must be some inheritance between each class and implement it in your code.
+ Output should be meaningful and it should be working
